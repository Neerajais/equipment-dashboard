# Static Equipment Healthiness Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive Power BI dashboard** designed to monitor and analyze the **health, inspection frequency, and risk levels** of static equipment such as vessels, tanks, columns, and heat exchangers.

It serves as a powerful visualization tool for equipment maintenance, reliability engineers, and safety officers to make informed decisions based on data.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dashboard is built using integrated datasets related to:

- **Equipment Type & ID**
- **Inspection History**
- **Risk Assessment Levels**
- **Next Due Dates for Inspection**
- **Health Status**
- **Inspection Types and Frequency**

Each data table contributes to a meaningful visualization that helps organizations manage equipment maintenance schedules and avoid potential risks or failures.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ **Overall Equipment Summary**  
  View total assets, inspected items, overdue equipment, and upcoming due inspections.

- ✅ **Interactive Filters**  
  Apply slicers to filter by **Plant**, **Area**, **Risk Level**, or **Equipment Type**.

- ✅ **Healthiness Breakdown by Equipment Type**  
  Understand the inspection status for each category such as tanks, columns, vessels, and heat exchangers.

- ✅ **Inspection Due Calendar**  
  Identify equipment whose inspection is **overdue**, **due this month**, or **scheduled for later**.

- ✅ **Risk-Level Visualization**  
  View high, medium, and low-risk assets with color-coded bar/column charts.
